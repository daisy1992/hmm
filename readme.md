# Hidden Markov Models Framework

This is a simple library that I developed during an internship in which I worked with
a Hidden Markov Models (HMM) framework. Since there were no available library that met my needs,
I had to develop one myself.

In this implementation, I use the famous Baum-Welch algorithm, itself derived from the
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
